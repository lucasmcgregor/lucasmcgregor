# My Projects
Most of my projects here are work related and private.

My public projects are mostly noodling to learn new technologies or to play with data.

# My Values
As a developer, a manager, and a humanbeing; I strive to behave and treat others according to my values and see out teams who do them same.

## People
- Empathy: Treat others as you want to be treated.
- Inclusion: Make room for people. Allow for differences.
- Ethical: People are not a means to an end. They are not units of production. Each person has their own inate drive and desires. Create win-wins for each other and avoid exploitation.

## Teams
- Psychological Safety: teams need to be safe. Safe to bring your fullself. Safe to ask questions. Safe to trust each other.
- Resilience: Things go wrong. Make room for mistakes, accidents, and the unexpected. Have enough reservoir to recover. Create situations that can thrive in change.
- Growth Mindset: Always be growing and learning. I am tempted to polish old skills, but challange yourself by failing at new ones. Continous improvement and always thinking that you are not just your title, your past, or your current mindset.
- More than Metrics: You cannot measure everthing. Data is an important signal from reality, but signals are proxies and not replacements. Modern management is obsessed with metrics to the point of confusing the map for the land.
- Drive Impact: Do the things that matter. Perfectionism is bad time management. Be pragmatic. Solve the problem, but understand the system.

## Problem Solving
- System thinking: engineers are natural analysts. We take things apart and understand the pieces. Strive to understand the holistic system. The purpose and connections of a system drive more impact than the individual parts.
- Multiple Viewpoints: systems are complex and cannot be understood by a single person or viewpoint. Use viewpoint frameworks to build composite understandings. The world is more of a collage than a portrait. Good architecture is fractal and works in multiple layers and repeats multiple patters.
- Make Lists: make lists. Make lots of lists. Keep lists of events, patterns, ideas, realtionships. Keep lists of lists. Instead of trying to fit the world into a rubrick, capture everything and apply rubricks as needed.
